- coutdown starts and timer is displayed immediatelly when on normal browser window
- timer display is delayed when on incognito/private browser window (reproducible in Chrome)

- input validation missing => for non-handled input we get directly the Time Expired! message 

- changing context from http to https after clicking GO!

- when reaching the end (1 second), it takes 2-3 seconds until it actually displays the Time Expired! message.
